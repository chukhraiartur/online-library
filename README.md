This project is the online library. 

The guest can view books by category. Books can be read or downloaded in the presented format. 

The user can add his own books, mark other books as favorites and write comments.

In this project, I used technologies such as:
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- Redis

Implemented features such as:
- Captcha
