This project is the online library. 

The guest can view books by category and search books by title or author. Books can be downloaded in the PDF format. 

The user can add his own books and mark other books as favorites.

In this project, I used technologies such as:
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

To-Do:
- add book reading page
- add docker so people can deploy the application on their system
- add a mailing list of new books to registered users every 24 hours
- add tests
